# K-Means-Image-Compression

This project demonstrates image compression using K-Means clustering.
The Jupyter notebook contains the implementation and results.

## Project Description

Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images to reduce their cost for storage or transmission. The K-Means algorithm is used to compress images by reducing the number of colors in the image.

## How It Works

1. Load the original image.
2. Apply K-Means clustering to reduce the number of colors.
3. Replace each pixel's color with the centroid of its cluster.

## Results

### Compression Percentage

The original image size was **66.78 KB** and the compressed image size is **42.3 KB**
